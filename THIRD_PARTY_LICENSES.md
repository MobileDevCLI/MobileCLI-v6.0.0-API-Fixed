## What is NOT Third-Party (Original MobileCLI Code)

The following is 100% original code owned by MobileCLI Team:

| File | Lines | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| MainActivity.kt | ~1,400 | Terminal UI, navigation drawer, gestures |
| BootstrapInstaller.kt | ~2,900 | Bootstrap download, extraction, scripts |
| TermuxApiReceiver.kt | ~2,000 | 75+ API command implementations |
| SetupWizard.kt | ~800 | 3-stage setup flow |
| TermuxService.kt | ~600 | Background service, wake locks |
| AmSocketServer.kt | ~440 | Proprietary Activity Manager (IPC) |
| Other files | ~800 | Activities, receivers, utilities |
| **TOTAL** | **~9,000+** | **100% Original** |

## Runtime Downloads (Not Bundled in APK)

The following are downloaded at runtime from official Termux package
repositories when users run the Setup Wizard. These are NOT part of
MobileCLI's source code and are NOT distributed by MobileCLI.

| Package | License | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| bash | GPL v3 | termux-packages |
| coreutils | GPL v3 | termux-packages |
| apt | GPL v2 | termux-packages |
| Python | PSF License | termux-packages |
| Node.js | MIT | termux-packages |
| Rust | MIT/Apache 2.0 | termux-packages |
| Various npm packages | Various | npm registry |

MobileCLI acts as a download client, similar to a web browser. Users
download these packages themselves; MobileCLI does not distribute them.

### GPL Compliance Note

MobileCLI does not statically or dynamically link against GPL code.
GPL-licensed binaries (bash, coreutils) are downloaded by the user
and run as independent processes. This is analogous to a web browser
downloading software — the browser itself is not bound by the
downloaded software's license.

GPL source code is available from the Termux project:
