## To Reactivate PayPal

1. Read `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for full instructions
2. Deploy webhook code from `WEBHOOK_CODE.md`
3. Run SQL from `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
4. Configure PayPal webhook URL in PayPal Dashboard
5. Test with payloads from `TEST_PAYLOADS.md`

## The Critical Fix (January 25, 2026)

**Problem:** Webhooks were receiving events but database wasn't updating.

**Root Cause:** Using `.update()` which returns empty array (not error) when no row matches.

**Solution:** Changed to `.upsert()` which creates the row if it doesn't exist.

See `STORY.md` for the full debugging journey.
